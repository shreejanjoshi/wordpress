This project is mostly about we understant the Concept of Wordpress. How to work in wordpress, how to edit it. The project is about Bakery.

## My wordpress website

- [Bakery Sweet](https://bakerysj.wordpress.com/)

## The Mission

A friend comes up to you now that you are an expert webdeveloper and asks if you could make a website for their bakery. Of course, they are willing to pay you for your hard work. You have talked about what they want, a top notch website representing their bakery with all of the sweet features you could possibly imagine. You're totally fired up and ready to start your new Angular project while you ponder about which cool modules you could use for this project.

Unfortunately when discussing the price of your hard work, your friend doesn't seem to understand the intricacy of the whole process. "100 bucks should be more than enough right?? I mean, I can make the website myself with Wix anyway if I want." -they said. So, now that you realise spending much time on this project would be bad for business, we need to think of a different solution.

"I can't possibly use Wix myself to make them a website, I'm a developer!" -you think to yourself. And this is when you realised the optimal solution for your problem, Wordpress! It's perfect! You can probably make everything your friend asked for in only a day, tops two! Your friend can be happy with the product, and you will not be spending weeks of your time on a measly 100 bucks. Win - win!

## Must-have features

- At least 2 pages
    *Both have to have a custom background color, not the original one! (it can be the same color on both pages)
    *Change the footer credit, notice how we cannot remove it? Optionally try hiding it anyway!
- At least 1 block of every category
    *They can be spread out across all of your pages
    *If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
- At least 1 hack block!
    *step 12: this block should be styled not by wordpress, but by your own injected CSS
    *Normally we need to get a premium account to add custom css, but there are sneaky ways around it.
-A contact form
-A font chosen by you
-A README on your repository linking to your website
